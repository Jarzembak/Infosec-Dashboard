        <p>
            Welcome to the InfoSec Launchpad.
            This site is meant to be a “One Stop Shop” for infosec and
            cyber security professionals. This field is very broad, with
            countless skills to master, and many career paths to choose from.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is a list of "soft" skills that will serve to carry through
            your career, no matter which path you find yourself.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Curiosity:</b> Seek to find out how things work.
                Ask questions and seek answers about things that
                catch your fancy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>A love of learning:</b> Similar to curiosity,
                always seek to learn more.
                Cultivate your inner sense of wonder at how
                things really work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Discipline:</b> When things get tedious (as they inevitably do),
                stick with it. Don't go from one thing to the next without
                disciplined, focused effort to accomplish your goal.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This website will not teach you to be curious,
            have a love of learning, or become more disciplined,
            but it will help you find the resources you need to
            learn more concretely defined skills. The resources
            can be divided into a few broad categories.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Sysadmin Tools:</b> Systems Administrators are
                the Jacks of all trades in the IT world, and often
                need to learn a broad range of skills and technologies
                to perform their jobs. This job is a common starting
                point for people who are looking to pivot into a more
                security focused role.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bug Bounty Tools: </b> Bug bounty hunting is something
                in which you find a participating company or program and hack
                their web presence. It is a unique career that anyone at any
                skill level can jump into. There are a plethora of platforms
                and programs that provide introductory training and labs for
                aspiring pentesters to learn the skills needed for successful
                bug bounty hunting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Home Lab Tools:</b> Every tech enthusiast has a use for a home
                lab. Whether this is just your laptop running a code editor, or
                a gaming desktop with the ability to virtualize an entire pentesting
                network, a home lab is essential for you to learn, play, and
                experiment with whatever you come up with.
