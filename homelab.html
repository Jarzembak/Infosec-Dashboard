			<p>A home lab is essential for a cyber security professional (or enthusiast). There are so many tutorials
				available
				for free (or at a low cost), that it makes it extremely easy to get stuck in the “learning” phase,
				without
				actually
				getting your hands on anything. Combine that with the plethora of certifications marketed towards job
				seekers, and
				you have a recipe for what is commonly referred to as “tutorial hell”. Your home lab is where real
				learning
				and
				understanding happens, and it is important to invest time in it. Even if you don't have high end
				hardware,
				there are
				still ways you can experiment at home.</p>

			<h2>Virtualization</h2>
			<p>The first thing I would recommend is some way to run virtual machines or containers. A virtual machine is
				an
				operating system that runs virtually within the operating system running on your computer. This virtual
				machine runs
				within a hypervisor, which sort of tricks it into thinking it is a totally separate computer. They can
				be
				completely
				isolated from your other software and apps, and can be created and deleted quickly, so if something goes
				wrong, you
				can easily start over without any consequences. Containers are similar, but instead of an entire
				operating
				system,
				you have a single app, or group of apps. These are often used by security researchers to package up a
				piece
				of
				vulnerable software with its configurations and dependencies all kept within the container. These can
				also
				be
				isolated from the rest of your system. Here is a list of common hypervisors and container management
				software, which
				you will need for virtualization.</p>

			<p>After you've taken your first step and have chosen your preferred virtualization solution, you are ready
				to
				begin
				your journey! Here is a list of resources to get you started with your homelab.</p>
