    <p>My name is Lee Jarzembak, and I am an IT systems administrator. I have been an IT enthusiast for the past 20
      years,
      but only entered the professional world in the area of IT around 2 years ago. I am a professional musician, and
      that
      has been the main focus of my study and efforts until recently. While performing as a musician, I did IT
      support as a side job in the Air Force. While I greatly enjoyed music, I was never fully committed to
      following a set path, and I went where life led me. I enjoy technology, music, fitness, and creating things of
      practical value. Recently I have started to enjoy woodworking projects, and I really love to get my hands on
      things
      and build.</p>
    <p>This site is mainly for me to have a place to put all the resources I come across in my search for knowledge. I
      aspire to learn more about penetration testing and ethical hacking, so I hope this site will help me keep my often
      scattered thoughts in order. </p>
    <p>I find it difficult to stay focused on any singular thing, so I hope this site helps me keep my focus on my
      specific
      goals. The field of cyber security greatly interests me, and I hope to one day be able to make a living as a bug
      bounty hunter. </p>
    <p>I am currently taking classes in programming and web development, and I plan to take more in cloud computing and
      cyber security in the near future.</p>

      Here is one of my favorite performances from my time in the Air Force. I'm the guy playing tuba <img
